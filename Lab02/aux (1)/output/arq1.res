"Bee's knees" This phrase became mainstream in the USA in the 1920s despite its British origins,
but its popularity in the States has dwindled since the turn of the century.
The "bee's knees" referred to small or insignificant details when it was first documented in the 18th century.
Since then, the phrase has evolved and refers to something at the "height of cool."
